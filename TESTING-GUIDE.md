# Testing Guide - Enhanced Prompt Personalization

## Environment Setup âœ…

Your local environment is ready to test!

```
Supabase API: http://127.0.0.1:54321
Supabase Studio: http://127.0.0.1:54323
Chat Function: http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/chat

Test User:
  Email: dev@mano.local
  Password: dev123456
```

## Quick Test Scenarios

### 1. Test Experience Level Personalization

**Setup:** Update test user's experience level in Supabase Studio:
- Go to http://127.0.0.1:54323
- Navigate to Table Editor â†’ user_profiles
- Find dev@mano.local user
- Edit `experience_level` field

**Test Cases:**

| Experience Level | Test Message | Expected Behavior |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `new` | "How do I give feedback?" | Should provide foundational context, explain concepts, be extra supportive |
| `experienced` | "How do I give feedback?" | Should assume fundamentals, focus on nuanced situations |
| `veteran` | "How do I give feedback?" | Should skip basics, engage with complex organizational dynamics |

### 2. Test Tone Preference

**Setup:** Update `tone_preference` in user_profiles table

**Test Cases:**

| Tone Preference | Test Message | Expected Behavior |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `direct` | "I'm struggling with a team member" | Concise, straightforward, actionable advice |
| `warm` | "I'm struggling with a team member" | Encouraging, supportive, acknowledges emotions |
| `conversational` | "I'm struggling with a team member" | Casual, friendly, peer advisor style |
| `analytical` | "I'm struggling with a team member" | Structured, framework-based, logical |

### 3. Test Situational Coaching

**No setup needed - just send these messages:**

| Message Type | Test Message | Expected Coaching Approach |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Self-reflection | "I feel worried about my leadership style" | Should ask coaching questions to deepen self-awareness |
| Interpersonal | "I have a conflict with my team member Alice" | Should explore multiple perspectives, ask about motivations |
| Performance | "Alice is underperforming on her tasks" | Should balance support and accountability, discuss root causes |
| Strategic | "I'm thinking about our long-term product roadmap" | Should ask about goals, stakeholders, tradeoffs |
| Tactical | "How do I structure my 1:1 meeting agenda?" | Should provide concrete frameworks and next steps |

### 4. Test Socratic Method

**Send messages in sequence to the same conversation:**

1. **First message (exploring):** "I'm thinking about changing my team's sprint format"
   - Expected: Should ask 1-2 clarifying questions before offering advice
   - Example: "What's making you consider this change?" or "What's not working with the current format?"

2. **Second message (seeking advice):** "Tell me how to run better sprint planning"
   - Expected: Should provide direct advice with one follow-up question

3. **Third message (urgent):** "I need to fix this today - urgent issue"
   - Expected: Should provide direct, actionable guidance immediately

### 5. Test Response Length Adaptation

| Message | Expected Length | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| "Should I do daily standups?" | 1-2 sentences | Simple, quick question |
| "How should I approach organizational restructuring and what factors should I consider?" | 3-4 sentences | Complex query |
| "Why is delegation important?" (as new manager) | 3-5 sentences | New manager + complex concept |

### 6. Test Enhanced Challenge Detection

**Setup:** Have several conversations about similar challenges

**Test:**
1. Send 5+ messages about being overwhelmed: "My team is overwhelmed", "Too much work", "Everyone is burning out"
2. Check the context in next response - should include in "CURRENT CHALLENGES DETECTED":
   - Workload Management (or similar)

**Note:** This requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env.local for LLM-based detection. Without it, falls back to keyword matching.

### 7. Test Cross-Person Mentions

**Setup:** Create multiple people in your team

**Test:**
1. In a conversation about Alice, say: "I think Bob could help mentor Alice"
2. In a conversation about Bob, check if context includes:
   ```
   TEAM CONNECTIONS (Recent cross-person mentions):
   - Alice mentioned Bob: "I think Bob could help mentor Alice"
   ```

## How to View Prompt Context

To see the actual system prompt being sent to Claude:

1. Open browser DevTools (Network tab)
2. Send a chat message
3. Look for request to `/functions/v1/chat`
4. View request payload - the system prompt is in the `messages` array

Or check function logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/supabase-functions.log
```

## Verifying Changes Work

### Check User Profile Data
```sql
SELECT call_name, job_role, experience_level, tone_preference
FROM user_profiles
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'dev@mano.local');
```

### Update Test User Profile
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET
  experience_level = 'veteran',
  tone_preference = 'analytical'
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'dev@mano.local');
```

Run this in Supabase Studio â†’ SQL Editor: http://127.0.0.1:54323

## Common Issues

### Functions not updating
```bash
# Restart Edge Functions
pkill -f "supabase functions serve"
supabase functions serve --env-file .env.local > /tmp/supabase-functions.log 2>&1 &
```

### Need fresh test data
```bash
npm run seed:dev reset
npm run seed:dev
```

### Check function logs
```bash
tail -f /tmp/supabase-functions.log
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Experience level changes response depth and complexity
âœ… Tone preference changes response style (direct vs warm vs analytical)
âœ… Situational detection triggers appropriate coaching approach
âœ… Socratic method asks questions vs gives advice based on context
âœ… Response length adapts to query complexity
âœ… Challenges are detected semantically (with API key) or via keywords
âœ… Cross-person mentions appear in team connections

## Next: iOS Testing

Once backend is validated, test in iOS app:
1. Build iOS app: `./scripts/build-test.sh`
2. Run in simulator
3. Sign in as dev@mano.local
4. Test same scenarios in the app
5. Verify responses match expectations

Happy testing! ðŸŽ‰
