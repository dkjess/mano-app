# Enhanced Prompt Personalization - Implementation Summary

**Branch:** `feature/enhanced-prompt-personalization`

## Phase 1: Core Personalization (✅ Complete)

### 1. User Profile Integration
**File:** `backend/supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`

- Updated user profile query to include `experience_level` and `tone_preference`
- Added helper functions:
  - `getExperienceLevelGuidance()` - Adapts coaching depth based on manager experience
  - `getToneGuidance()` - Adjusts response tone (direct/warm/conversational/analytical)

**Impact:** Mano now personalizes responses based on manager's experience and preferred communication style.

### 2. Situational Coaching Patterns
**File:** `backend/supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`

- Added `detectProblemType()` function - Identifies:
  - Self-reflection
  - Interpersonal challenges
  - Performance management
  - Strategic thinking
  - Tactical execution

**Impact:** Mano adapts coaching approach based on the type of challenge being discussed.

### 3. Response Length Adaptation
**File:** `backend/supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`

- Added `determineResponseLengthGuidance()` function
- Dynamically adjusts from "1-2 sentences" to "3-5 sentences" based on:
  - Query complexity
  - Manager experience level
  - Whether it's a quick question

**Impact:** More appropriate response depth for different situations.

## Phase 2: Socratic Method & Intelligence (✅ Complete)

### 4. Socratic Method Framework
**File:** `backend/supabase/functions/chat/index.ts`

- Added `determineCoachingApproach()` function - Detects:
  - Urgent situations → Direct advice immediately
  - Early exploration → Use Socratic questioning
  - Seeking advice → Provide guidance with follow-up question
  - Problem exploration → Guide discovery with questions

**Impact:** Mano shifts between asking questions and giving advice based on context, enabling manager self-discovery.

### 5. Enhanced Challenge Detection
**File:** `backend/supabase/functions/_shared/management-context.ts`

- Updated `detectCurrentChallenges()` to use LLM when API key available
- Added `detectChallengesWithLLM()` - Uses Claude Sonnet 4 to:
  - Analyze last 20 messages semantically
  - Identify recurring patterns vs one-off mentions
  - Return up to 5 genuine management challenges

**Impact:** More accurate challenge detection, better awareness of manager's current struggles.

### 6. Cross-Person Mention Detection
**File:** `backend/supabase/functions/_shared/management-context.ts`

- Updated `analyzeConversationPatterns()` to be async
- Added `detectCrossPersonMentions()` function:
  - Detects when people mention other team members in conversations
  - Returns top 10 most recent mentions with context
  - Added to formatted prompt as "TEAM CONNECTIONS" section

**Impact:** Surfaces team dynamics and relationships across conversations.

## Testing Setup

### Local Environment Ready ✅
```bash
# Supabase is running
API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323

# Edge Functions served with .env.local
http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/chat

# Test user credentials
Email: dev@mano.local
Password: dev123456
```

### What to Test

1. **Experience Level Adaptation:**
   - User with `experience_level: 'new'` should get more foundational explanations
   - User with `experience_level: 'veteran'` should get strategic, high-level advice

2. **Tone Preference:**
   - `tone_preference: 'direct'` → Concise, actionable
   - `tone_preference: 'warm'` → Encouraging, supportive
   - `tone_preference: 'analytical'` → Structured, framework-based

3. **Situational Coaching:**
   - Ask "I feel worried about my leadership" → Should trigger self-reflection coaching
   - Ask "I have a conflict with Bob" → Should trigger interpersonal coaching approach
   - Ask "How do I handle underperformance?" → Should trigger performance management approach

4. **Socratic Method:**
   - First message: "I'm considering changing my 1:1 format" → Should ask clarifying questions
   - Direct request: "Tell me how to run better 1:1s" → Should give direct advice

5. **Response Length:**
   - Simple: "Should I do daily standups?" → Should get 1-2 sentence answer
   - Complex: "How do I approach organizational restructuring?" → Should get 3-5 sentences

6. **Enhanced Challenges:**
   - Have conversations about burnout, communication issues → Should appear in "CURRENT CHALLENGES DETECTED"

7. **Cross-Person Mentions:**
   - In Alice's conversation, mention Bob → Should appear in "TEAM CONNECTIONS" section

## Next Steps

1. Test all personalization features with dev user
2. Verify LLM challenge detection works (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env.local)
3. Test cross-person mention detection with multi-person conversations
4. Validate tone and experience level adaptations
5. Ensure Socratic method triggers appropriately

## Future Enhancements (Not in This PR)
